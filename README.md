# Deer

An alternative to "express" in deno.
I created it as my first project getting in to deno.

### Goals:

1. Making it work with things out of the box:

   - GraphQL
   - CORS

2. Make it easy to work with and intuitive. **Simplicity**.

### Help me maintain the project

Deer is a one-man project. All pull requests will be reviewed and appreciated.
